## About the Project  
**What is it?**  
A collaborative 2D game using Godot’s sprite-stacking technique to simulate depth — you and your friends build and navigate customizable ships across mystical seas.

**Why are we doing this?**  
- To explore sprite stacking in Godot and craft modular, procedurally generated ships.  
- To gain experience with team-based development — version control, scene merging, and cooperative workflows.

## Features  
-  Modular ship building with sprite stack engine  
-  Procedural island and sea generation  
-  Co-op ship navigation, handling, and exploration  
-  Dynamic weather and sea effects (waves, rain, fog)
